This script gathers new court filing from Xchange to produce a list of names and addresses for lawyers to send mailers to look for new clients.

The credentials.py file must be updated with your Xchange username and password and queries.py file must be updated to process the queries you'd like to process.

This script was built for Lakey Hogelin (www.lakeyhogelin.com), but has been open-sourced.
